Currency data and updated currency exchange rates for WordPress.


== Description ==

WP Currencies uses [openexchangerates.org](http://www.openexchangerates.org/) to pull currency data and currency exchange rates in WordPress.

The currencies and their exchange rates will be periodically updated at intervals set from the WordPress dashboard by an administrator.

The plugin is intended for developers that want to access currencies data and currency exchange rates from within WordPress and perform basic currency rates conversions. WP Currencies comes with a functions library to retrieve currency data and exchange rates as PHP arrays or json objects in ajax calls. 

Furthermore, it extends [JSON REST WP API]( https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) with new routes, and, if you use [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) (ACF), WP Currencies will also add a new "Currency" field for use in ACF.

If you use [WPML](http://wpml.org/) and have both [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) and [WooCommerce MultiLingual](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-multilingual/) installed, you can use this plugin to filter WCML currency rate using [one of their hooks](https://wpml.org/documentation/related-projects/woocommerce-multilingual/multi-currency-support-woocommerce/) and update rates on the fly.

**Important** - You will need an API key from http://www.openexchangerates.org/ to pull currency data and make this plugin work properly (either choose the forever free plan or one of their premium subscriptions).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've installed the plugin but I don't see anything! =

Please read again the plugin description and read the [documentation](https://github.com/nekojira/wp-currencies/wiki). 
WP Currencies by this time doesn't offer any WYSIWYG functionality, but it's intended for developers who want to build solutions using currency data and exchange rates - which this plugin provides with an API for using those in WordPress.

= Is this plugin created or endorsed by Open Exchange Rates? =

No it is not. It just makes use of their public API within their Terms and Conditions policy: [https://openexchangerates.org/terms](https://openexchangerates.org/terms).

= Can you guarantee that the currency exchange rates provided will be accurate? =

**No.** As Open Exchange Rates itself says: "Exchange rates are provided for informational purposes only, and do not constitute financial advice of any kind. Although every attempt is made to ensure quality, NO guarantees are given whatsoever of accuracy, validity, availability, or fitness for any purpose - please use at your own risk."
It is not recommended to use this plugin in critical business scenarios. The plugin author(s) nor the currency exchange rates provider(s) will not be responsible for financial loss or damage caused by data inaccuracies. Please refer to the GPL license and Open Exchange Rates terms and conditions for further information.

= What if I exceed my Open Exchange Rates API request quota? =

This plugin will be unable to update the database and older, may throw a warning when it tries to do so (as if it would with an invalid API key) and less accurate currency rates will be used (those recorded in the database at the time of the last update).
You can monitor your quota usage according to your subscription plan by logging into your Open Exchange Rates account at [https://openexchangerates.org/](https://openexchangerates.org/).
From the plugin settings, you can specify a less frequent interval of database updates to make less API requests. Please note that if you make use of the API elsewhere and perform more requests, they will be counted by Open Exchange Rates and summed up with the ones triggered by this plugin.

= WP Currencies runs but the currencies aren't refreshed at the intervals I've set - why? =

This could be related to `cron` not working properly in your host. Please refer to the `Troubleshooting` section of [WP Currencies documentation](https://github.com/nekojira/wp-currencies/wiki).
